There was a really nice person I met on STALCRAFT, so I thought, they're mean, vile, and it's scary because I didn't sense that at first.  If this person is flirting with you, they will abandon, ghost, and remove any traces of themselves from your life. I hope this warning serves a purpose to someone.

After so many "I love you", "You make me smile all day long", "I want someone to take me to the Cherokee Mountains", "I can't wait until we meet", "ilysm", "who are you?", I had to do this write up, thanks for reading.
